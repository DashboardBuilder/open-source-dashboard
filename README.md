## Open Source Dashboard Overview
Open source dashboard applications can be deployed, scaled, and optimized, free of charge on the premises
The Dashboard Builder is a free and open source framework for creating analytic web applications. It's mostly used to create internal <a href="https://dashboardbuilder.net/blogs/business-intelligence-dashboard" alt="Business Intelligence">business intelligence tools</a> or to add customer-facing analytics to existing applications. In most cases, the first step in developing such an application is to create an analytics dashboard. "Let's add an analytics dashboard to our admin panel," it usually begins. Then, as is customary in software development, things become much more complicated.

When we first started working on the <a href="https://dashboardbuilder.net/blogs/business-intelligence-dashboard" alt="Open Source Dashboard">open source dashboard builder</a>, we wanted to create a tool that is simple to use but quickly scales in terms of features, complexity, and data volume. The open source dashboard builder lays the groundwork for your future analytical system, whether it be a standalone application or one that is integrated into an existing one.

We'll walk you through the fundamentals of creating your first dashboard, from the database to <a href="https://dashboardbuilder.net/data-visualization-tool" alt="Data Visualization Tool">the visualizations</a>, with the open source dashboard.

## Open Source License 
The bulk of modern online apps are constructed with open source code, which is released under an open source licence such as MIT. This MIT licence has few restrictions on reuse and excellent licencing compatibility. This licence allows for reuse within proprietary source code developed by our dashboard utility. The MIT License terms and the copyright notice are included in all copies of the source code. This licence also works with several copyleft licences, including the GNU General Public License (GPL). Our open-source tool generates source code that may be included into GPL applications.
Similarly, the <a href="https://dashboardbuilder.net/blogs/business-intelligence-dashboard" alt="Open Source Dashboard at GitHub">Open Source Dashboard GitHub</a> is used to generate this <a href="https://dashboardbuilder.net/blogs/business-intelligence-dashboard" alt="PHP Dashboard">auto-generated PHP source code</a>. It is licenced under the MIT licence, which is the most popular software licence on GitHub. 


## Frontend
We will build our interface and <a href="https://dashboardbuilder.net/php-dashboard" alt="Dashboard in PHP">dashboard in PHP</a> using HTML, JQuery and Bootstrap 5 libraries.

Building a Dashboard
There are some best practices for designing the dashboard layout.
The most common practice is to list the relevant breakdowns of the most important and high-level metrics at the top as single value charts, sometimes referred to as KPIs.
Here's the link to our final dashboard, which <a href="https://dashboardbuilder.net/kpi-dashboard" alt="KPI Dashboard">features KPIs</a> at the top, followed by bar and line charts. 

## Next Steps
With the open source dashboard builder, we created a simple proof of concept dashboard. You can see a <a href="https://dashboardbuilder.net/examples" alt="Open Source Dashboard Examples">live demo here</a>. The open source code can be found on GitHub.
